   git clone https://github.com/Lawrencenabbsolomon/ion-neuro-data-platform.git
   cd ion-neuro-data-platform
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the environment:
   Ensure you have the necessary environment variables configured. Refer to the `env.example` file for guidance.

4. Run the platform:

   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the platform. The main interface allows you to select different modules for data ingestion, signal processing, and machine learning.

### Data Ingestion

You can ingest data from various sources such as CSV files, databases, or real-time data streams. Use the `ingest_data` function to load your data into the platform.

### Signal Processing

The platform includes a range of signal processing functions. You can apply filters, perform Fourier transforms, and analyze time-series data.

### Machine Learning

To utilize machine learning models, select the appropriate model and provide your processed data. The platform supports various algorithms, including classification and regression.

## Data Processing Pipelines

The data ingestion pipelines are designed to streamline the process of collecting and preparing data for analysis. 

### Pipeline Structure

1. **Data Source**: Specify the source of your data (e.g., CSV, database).
2. **Data Cleaning**: Remove any inconsistencies or missing values.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the raw data.
4. **Data Storage**: Store the processed data for further analysis.

### Example Pipeline

```python
from data_pipeline import DataPipeline

pipeline = DataPipeline(source='data.csv')
pipeline.clean_data()
pipeline.extract_features()
pipeline.store_data('processed_data.csv')
```

## Signal Processing Techniques

Signal processing is crucial for analyzing neural data. The platform includes several techniques:

- **Filtering**: Remove noise from signals.
- **Fourier Transform**: Analyze frequency components of signals.
- **Wavelet Transform**: Examine localized variations of power within a time series.

### Example of Signal Filtering

```python
from signal_processing import SignalProcessor

processor = SignalProcessor(signal_data)
filtered_signal = processor.apply_filter()
```

## Machine Learning Models

The platform supports various machine learning models for pattern recognition. You can choose from pre-trained models or train your own.

### Training a Model

To train a model, prepare your dataset and use the following code:

```python
from ml_models import ModelTrainer

trainer = ModelTrainer(data='processed_data.csv')
trainer.train_model(model_type='classification')
```

### Using a Pre-trained Model

You can also use pre-trained models for quick analysis:

```python
from ml_models import ModelPredictor

predictor = ModelPredictor(model='pretrained_model')
predictions = predictor.make_predictions(new_data)
```
